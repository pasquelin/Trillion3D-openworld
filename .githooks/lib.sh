# Shared by the tracked git hooks: every change reaches main through an issue and a pull request,
# whoever (or whatever) types the command. Installed by `pnpm install` (`prepare`:
# `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`). Each hook ends by delegating to the hook of the same name
# installed locally in .git/hooks, so core.hooksPath preserves personal hooks.
